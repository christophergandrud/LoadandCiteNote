LoadandCiteNote
===============

A short note on how to use the LoadandCite command for documenting R packages used in reproducible research.

To reproduce the document [knit](http://yihui.name/knitr/) the file `Gandrud.Rnw`. You will need to install the [repmis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/repmis/) package (version 0.2.6 was used in the paper) before knitting the file.
